The **Crop Monitoring System** is designed to efficiently manage and optimize agricultural operations. It addresses various aspects of farming, including crop management, staff operations, field monitoring, vehicle management, and equipment utilization. The system aims to streamline agricultural processes and improve productivity as operations scale.

### Key Features:
- **Crop Management**: Manage multiple fields, each designated for specific crops.
- **Staff and Vehicle Tracking**: Record staff, vehicle, and equipment usage for better operational tracking.
- **Data Visualization**: Visualize data with charts and maps for real-time insights into farming operations.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Implement role-based access to ensure secure and restricted access to sensitive data.
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Forgot Password Feature**: Allows users to reset their password via email.
- **Client-Side Validation**: Validation has been implemented on the front end to ensure user input is correct before submission, including checks for required fields, correct formats, and other constraints.
- **Sorted Data**: Relevant entities, such as staff, vehicles, and crops, are sorted by key criteria like Name, Designation, Gender, Vehicle Type, Land Size, and Status.
  
This front-end system is built using modern web technologies, ensuring a highly interactive and user-friendly experience.
